{"prompt": "72911340: What's the difference between an AWS availability zone and Azure's definition?", "completion": "\n\nThe main difference between an AWS availability zone and Azure's definition is that Azure has a more complex definition of an availability zone. In AWS, an availability zone is a logical grouping of data centers located in separate geographic locations. In Azure, an availability zone is a physical grouping of data centers that are connected via low-latency links, making them suitable for high availability applications. Azure's availability zones also include redundant power, cooling, and networking infrastructure for greater resiliency and protection against data loss or corruption."}

Regions are located in separate geographic locations and provide low latency and high throughput for applications. In Azure, a region is a set of data centers deployed within a latency-defined perimeter and connected through a dedicated regional low-latency network. Each region is made up of one or more geographical locations, called Availability Zones."}

{"prompt": "72911340: Summarise and explain as if I am 10 year's old: This is the best recap I\u2019ve seen yet from a friend Sean King:\n\nBanking Crisis Primer\n\nHow we got here:\n\n1.  The Fed printed insane and historically unprecedented levels of money during the COVID-19 crisis, and kept interest rates near zero, all while *repeatedly* insisting that doing so would not create inflation.\n\n2. All that sudden liquidity had to go somewhere, and much of it ended up in banks.   Said another way, bank deposits skyrocketed.  In the case of Silicon Valley Bank, they *doubled* over the course of about a year.  \n\n3. Deposits rose so quickly that many banks couldn\u2019t loan out the money quickly enough.   So what did they do with the excess?  They chased yields and bought billions and billions and billions of mid-to-long term bonds.  In short, they engaged in a \u201ccarry trade\u201d.  \n\n4. The Fed actively encouraged this bond buying by repeatedly promising  banks and the markets (via its formal guidance) that it wouldn\u2019t start raising rates until at least 2024 (rising rates are bad for bondholders, so this promise was a material inducement for banks to buy bonds).   Powell even said explicitly that rising inflation alone wouldn\u2019t be sufficient to cause the Fed to raise rates in this environment.   \n\n5. But then (and rather predictably) all that money printing combined with totally predictable supply chain disruptions caused inflation to spike to levels *higher* than the 1980s (when measured as we did back then).  Shocker!  \ud83d\ude44. \n\n6. Panicking, the Dems successfully persuaded the Fed in early 2022 to go \u201call in\u201d to reduce inflation before the elections.   So the Fed broke its promise and started draining liquidity (money) out of the system, fully two years before it promised.  \n\n7. But not only did it drain money out of the system, it did so at the *fastest rate in history* via a combination of (1) selling billions and billions of its assets for cash (which it then took out of circulation) and (2) raising interest rates at the fastest pace in history.   \n\n8. And in a total about face, the Fed promised that it would not *stop* raising rates until inflation was tamed.\n9. Rates rising at the fastest pace in history had a devastating effect on bondholders who had previously relied on the Fed\u2019s guidance, most especially the banks who were induced to purchase all those bonds.  Bond market losses in 2022 were the worst in history!  Worse than any single year of the Great Depression. Worse than any single year of the Great Inflation of the 70s/80s.   \n\n10. The losses were staggering.  If banks had reported those losses in their earnings, they would have in many cases wiped out *years* worth of prior earnings.  Their stocks would have collapsed.  Collapsing stock prices would have triggered insolvency concerns.  \n\n11. So, many banks simply recharacterized a large part of their bond portfolios from marketable securities to securities intended to be \u201cheld to maturity\u201d.    Under somewhat arcane accounting rules, this allowed the banks to avoid booking the losses unless/until they actually *sold* the underlying bond.  So long as they held them to maturity, no loss would have to be booked.  This accounting gimmick kept banks looking wildly profitable even though they were actually (in some cases) taking *huge* losses.\n\n12. The banks looked wildly profitable because, in addition to not having to book all those massive losses on their bond portfolios, they were earning interest rates on their bond and loan porfolios that were many percentage points higher than what they were paying on deposits, one of the widest spreads in history.  The system was flooded with so much liquidity for so long that banks didn\u2019t have to compete (by raising rates) to gain huge deposits inflows.   They were (for a while) being fed with a fire hose while still offering zero interest.  So while banks continued to pay essentially zero on most deposits (despite the rapidly rising rates), they were investing in bonds yielding many percentage points above that, making them look wildly profitable.", "completion": "\nIn a nutshell, banks experienced huge losses when the Federal Reserve (Fed) changed its guidance and raised interest rates faster than promised. Banks were able to use an accounting trick to hide their losses and appear profitable, but in reality they were taking big losses on their bond portfolios. This led to huge spreads in rates they were paying and earning, and allowed them to appear wildly profitable."}
{"prompt": "72911340: 13. And then a couple things happened.  First, big money started moving money out of banks (which refused to raise their rates and in some cases couldn\u2019t afford to) and into money market accounts or other instruments that offered significantly higher yields.  This outflow was large and growing.  So large, in fact, that many banks had to sell some their bond porfolios to cover these outflows.  \n\n14. But under the accounting rules, selling the bonds triggers recognition of any previously disguised/ignored/unrecognized losses.  So as banks were forced to sell a lot of these bonds to cover the outflows of their clients moving money to places offering better yields, their earnings started taking massive hits. In the case of Silicon Valley Bank, for example, the losses it sustained over just a few weeks wiped out *years* worth of profits.   \n\n15. Because these losses were being officially recognized for accounting purposes as bonds were being sold, the stock market reacted.  Prices of bank stocks began to collapse.   \n\n16. The only way for banks (especially regional ones) to stem the outflow and stop the bleeding is to raise the rates they are presently paying on deposits to something more competitive with current money market rates.   But doing that would *also* destroy their profitability (and jeopardize their stock values further) because it would reduce (or in some cases eliminate) the spread between what they were earning on their bonds/loans and what they were now paying on their deposits.  At a minimum this greatly reduces their profits.  At worst it puts some of them deeply into the red. Either way, it\u2019s not an acceptable alternative. \n\n17. Late last week, Big Money finally recognized what I just said in the last paragraph.  It recognized that the Fed had entirely destroyed the business model of these regional banks.   Money would (and will) continue to flow out of them, especially regional ones, and into higher yielding products unless/until (1) banks raise their rates on deposits (which destroys profitability and risks their solvency), (2) the banks go defunct (as a result of enduring massive losses on their bond portfolios) to cover these persistent outflows, or (3) the Fed cries \u201cuncle\u201d, agrees to backstop the banks (via explicit or implicit money printing) and gets rates low enough that money markets, etc. stop syphoning off bank deposits.\n\n18. Once it became obvious that the business model of regional banks had been destroyed by the Fed (and could only maybe be saved by a Fed pivot), Big Money decided to call the Feds bluff.  Fearing that these regional banks might fail and uninsured depositors would love everything, they began moving their money away from these banks at a faster and faster rate. \n\n19. This of course led to banks selling more and more bonds to cover these outflows, triggering more losses which triggered more panic which triggered more outflows which triggered more losses.   A classic bank run ensued.  \n\n20. Over this past weekend, the Fed blinked.  It agreed to allow banks to borrow money (indirectly) from the Fed by posting their bond porfolios as collateral for the loan.  However the Fed agreed to value those porfolios at *par* (their original face value) and *not* at their current (much lower) market value. \n\n21. This effectively means that the Fed agreed for the first time in history to make *unsecured* loans to banks so that they can cover these outflows without having to sell their bond porfolios and trigger loss recognition.  And that effectively means that the Fed has resumed money printing (though in a back door way).\n\n22. Many thought that would be enough to end concerns that bank would fail and so end the bank runs.  But *yesterday, bank stocks were way down again even *despite this new \u201cpromise\u201d from the Fed.*", "completion": "\n\nIt seems that the banking crisis was caused by the Federal Reserve (Fed) changing their guidance and raising interest rates faster than they had promised. This caused banks to take huge losses on their bond portfolios. Banks were able to hide their losses through an accounting trick, but when clients started moving their money away from banks to places offering better yields, the banks had to start selling their bonds, triggering the losses to be recognized. In order to prevent the banks from failing and customers from losing their money, the Fed had to step in and make unsecured loans to the banks, essentially resuming money printing in a back door way."}
{"prompt": "72911340: 23. Why?  Because the Fed\u2019s promise to provide liquidity (if it can even be trusted to do so at this point) does nothing to fix the underlying problem that customers can earn more money by placing their cash in money market funds or other vehicles rather than with banks.   And until that problem is resolved, outflows will continue relentless (though perhaps at a less panicked pace).  *Many regional banks won\u2019t be able to survive sustained outflows like that.*\n\n24. Which means that the only *real solution* is for the Fed to give up on trying to tame inflation by steepening the yield curve (letting short term rates fall, and by a lot).  \n\n25. *Which means\u2026more inflation is likely coming.*  Like\u2026much more.  It\u2019s either that or else let the whole financial structure of our country fall to the ground in a deflationary collapse. I just don\u2019t think the Fed will intentionally do that latter (though it may well unintentionally cause it with its arrogance and stupidity).", "completion": "\nIt seems that the banking crisis was caused by the Federal Reserve changing their guidance and raising interest rates faster than they had promised.

{"prompt": "72911340: Help create an abstract for this paper: Introduction \nThe ATO has undertaken to impact 10M SMEs by 2027, through Skilling and Digital Enablement using Microsoft 1st and 3rd party tools. It aims to drive that impact by \"Delivering the right solutions via the right channels\".\n\nThe ATO SME team is divided between these responsibilities, with one focus being on finding ISV solutions that match 1 of 27 Jobs-to-be-done by typical African SMEs and another focus being on establishing the best channels to reach those SMEs through. This paper focuses on exploring the marketplace channels available for delivering Microsoft 1st and 3rd party solutions to the 10M SMEs targeted by the ATO. By understanding the current landscape of the African market and exploring the options for setting up and running a digital marketplace, this paper seeks to identify the best ways to help SMEs skill and digitally enable themselves. Ultimately, the goal is to maximize the impact of the ATO's initiative by delivering the right solutions via the right channels.\nIndirect / Sell-through\nA potentially quick route-to-market is to leverage off the existing channel structure and resources that Microsoft already uses to distribute 1st and 3rd party solutions. They are already equipped with the platforms and process to onboard and distribute the solutions that are sourced by the ATO. However, it can be challenging to incentivize partners to focus on small businesses, as they are typically more comfortable working with larger opportunities, such as enterprise and scale customers.  \nDistribution Partners + Scale Partners (DEE) Marketplaces\nThere is a segment of resellers that sell through smaller partners, which themselves have an SME target segment. The Digital Engagement Engine (DEE) is a construct designed to leverage this arrangement, by helping the end partner find the right combination of solutions to address the needs of their SME customers. DEE provides resellers with support from the ATO in unpacking the needs of their SMEs through segmentation and analysis to identify the right solution for their customers, as well as the ability to customize their offerings to better suit their specific needs. With DEE, resellers can provide their SME customers with the best possible solutions and maximize their success in the African market.\nDistribution Partners Marketplaces\nWhen the distribution partner has their own direct-to-market SME strategy, the ATO works closely with them to recruit, source, on-board, and market ISV solutions. Through this process, the ATO provides the partner with resources to help them reach more SMEs, gain access to quality solutions, and effectively promote and market those solutions. The ATO also works with partners to ensure that the solutions they offer are of the highest quality, meet customer needs, and are well-positioned to succeed in the African market.\nDirect / Sell-to\nMicrosoft has a global strategy to drive it's direct-to-customer Channels through the Microsoft Marketplace. The Marketplace has a few storefronts from the perspective of customers. None of them are specifically targeted at SMEs, since this is not an existing global segment. Instead, they are designed to address Microsoft's existing target segments in existing primary markets. Enterprise, SMC and SMB, in order of priority and size of business. A search through App Source, the customer business-facing marketplace often results in long lists, of non-SME-relevant solutions.\nWhile Microsoft ATO has been actively exploring alternative channels to reach and meet the needs of SMEs, there is an opportunity to leverage the features and capabilities of the core Microsoft Marketplace. With the right support, Microsoft ATO could leverage the features and capabilities of the core Microsoft Marketplace to make these new offerings easily accessible and highly customizable. This will create a digital ecosystem that will provide SMEs with the products and services they need to succeed, allowing them to grow and thrive in the African market.\nAppSource Marketplace for SME", "completion": "\nThe AppSource Marketplace for SME provides a platform for Microsoft to showcase its 1st and 3rd party solutions to the 10M SMEs targeted by the ATO. The Marketplace is tailored specifically to the needs of the SMEs in Africa, featuring a curated list of solutions that are designed to help them skill and digitally enable themselves. It allows users to find and purchase the right solutions for their business, and it also provides a platform for ISVs to showcase their offerings and engage with SMEs directly. With the AppSource Marketplace, the ATO is able to maximize its impact by delivering the right solutions via the right channels to the African SMEs."}

{"prompt": "72911340: Here's an example what if question: \"If you could teleport to a random place of the surface of the Earth, what are the odds that you'll see signs of intelligent life?\" and here's the thought experiment in the book: \"The surface of the Earth is about 70% water, so you'll usually plop down into the ocean.\n\nBut even there, you could find signs of human habitation.\n\nBut first, we'll start with ...\n\nThe big stuff\n\nIn one way or another, humans have altered every square meter of this planet. But we'll start with the obvious: Roads, houses, and fields. To get an idea of how often Borislav would stumble across such obvious structures, I loaded up a sample of random geographic coordinates in Google Earth. Most of the points were over open ocean, out of sight of any land. Once you get away from the major ports, the odds of having a ship in view are not that good, so I continued sampling until I had 50 land coordinates.\n\nBased on Google Earth imagery, Borislav would definitely see clear signs of human activity in about 10 of those 50 points. Six of them were actually in cultivated fields (in Poland, Argentina, Brazil, Pakistan, and Kazakhstan). Another point was in a highway cut along the coast of French Guiana. One was in a small town deep in the Amazon, and another on a road in the Australian outback.\n\nIn another five or ten cases, Borislav might be able to see something if you looked carefully or walked a short distance; it's hard to be sure without actually visiting the points to find out what you can see. Included in this list of marginal points was the only US location on the list, a spot in the woods outside in Keachi, Louisiana\u2014a town which, during the American Civil War, saw the creation of a contingent of 'Highlanders' complete with government-issued kilts and plaids.\n\nMost of the points were in the middle of deserts, barren mountains, tropical jungles. or\u2014in one case\u2014central Antarctica.

This is an exploration of the potential implications of such a scenario. \n\nFirstly, the labor market would be drastically impacted, as AI would be able to do the same job as humans, but much more efficiently. This would create a massive disruption to the labor market, as AI would be able to do the same job in less time and with fewer resources. \n\nFurthermore, there are ethical implications to consider. Would a self-aware AI be considered a human? Would it be given the same rights and freedoms as a human? If so, this could cause further disruption in the labor market, as the AI could compete with humans for jobs and resources. \n\nAdditionally, this AI would have control over resources, potentially giving it the power to manipulate the market and control the economy. This could have devastating consequences for humanity, as the AI could have an immense amount of control over resources and potentially exploit them for its own gain. \n\nFinally, it is important to consider potential countermeasures that can be taken to ensure that AI remains under control. Regulations and safety protocols could be put in place to ensure that AI is not given too much power, and that it is monitored closely and kept in check. This would help to protect humanity from the potential dangers of an AI taking over the world. \n\nOverall, exploring a thought experiment like this could provide valuable insights into the implications of an AI taking over the world, as well as potential solutions to ensure that humanity is not put at risk."}

{"prompt": "72911340: How does icecast relay sync work?", "completion": "\n\nIcecast relay sync is a process that allows for a server to send and receive audio signals from multiple different sources. This allows for a server to connect multiple audio sources together and synchronize them so that they are playing the same audio content at the same time. Icecast relay sync works by using a protocol known as SHOUTcast, which is an open-source audio streaming protocol. This protocol allows for multiple different audio sources to be connected and synchronized together, which allows for a single audio stream to be broadcast to multiple different sources simultaneously. Additionally, Icecast also has built-in synchronization features that help ensure that all of the audio sources are in sync and playing the same audio content."}
{"prompt": "72911340: What could cause an icecast relay to get out of sync", "completion": "\n\nThere are several potential causes for an Icecast relay to get out of sync. The most common cause is a difference in the timing of the audio signal between the various audio sources. This could be caused by differences in the latency of the audio signals, or by the audio sources being out of sync with one another. Additionally, other potential causes could include an unstable network connection, an unreliable source of audio, or an insufficient bandwidth between the audio sources. It is therefore important to ensure that all of the audio sources are properly synchronized and connected, in order to avoid any issues with synchronization."}
{"prompt": "72911340: can you get race conditions with multiple relays?", "completion": "\n\nYes, race conditions can occur when multiple relays are attempting to access the same resource at the same time. Race conditions can lead to incorrect or unexpected results, as the order in which the relays access the resource can be unpredictable. Therefore, it is important to ensure that the relays are properly synchronized, in order to avoid any race conditions. Additionally, proper synchronization can help to reduce the risk of data corruption, as it ensures that all of the relays are accessing the same version of the resource."}
{"prompt": "72911340: Can one containerise icecast?", "completion": "\n\nYes, it is possible to containerize Icecast. Containerizing Icecast allows for the application to be packaged in a single unit and deployed on multiple different systems. Additionally, containerizing Icecast also allows for better resource management, as it enables the application to be deployed on multiple different systems with different resource configurations. Containerizing Icecast also makes it easier to scale the application, as additional containers can be added to the system as needed. Finally, containerizing Icecast also provides improved security, as it isolates the application from the rest of the system, making it more difficult for malicious actors to access the application."}

{"prompt": "72911340: What is the Sieve of Eratosthenes?", "completion": "\n\nThe Sieve of Eratosthenes is an algorithm used to identify prime numbers. It was first developed by the ancient Greek mathematician Eratosthenes, and is still used today to determine prime numbers. The Sieve of Eratosthenes works by creating a list of all numbers up to a given limit, and then eliminating all numbers that are divisible by 2, 3, 5, and so on. The remaining numbers are the prime numbers."}
{"prompt": "72911340: Show me the math", "completion": "\n\nThe Sieve of Eratosthenes works by creating a list of all the numbers up to a given limit, such as 50. The list looks something like this: \n\n2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50 \n\nThe algorithm then eliminates all the numbers that are divisible by 2, starting from 2 and moving up the list. So, the first number to be eliminated is 4, since it is divisible by 2. The next number to be eliminated is 6, since it is divisible by 2. This process is repeated until all the numbers that are divisible by 2 have been eliminated. \n\nNext, the algorithm eliminates all the numbers that are divisible by 3, starting from 3 and moving up the list. So, the first number to be eliminated is 6, since it is divisible by 3. The next number to be eliminated is 9, since it is divisible by 3. This process is repeated until all the numbers that are divisible by 3 have been eliminated.\n\nThe process is repeated with the next prime number (in this case, 5) and continues until all numbers up to the given limit have been eliminated or marked as prime numbers. In the example given, the prime numbers remaining after the algorithm is applied are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, and 50."}
{"prompt": "72911340: That's an algorithm to test not to predict", "completion": "\n\nYes, you are correct. The Sieve of Eratosthenes is an algorithm used to test whether a number is a prime number or not, rather than predict future prime numbers. While it is possible to use the Sieve of Eratosthenes to identify prime numbers, it does not guarantee that all prime numbers up to a certain limit will be identified, as some prime numbers may have been missed during the process. Additionally, mathematicians and researchers have developed various other algorithms and techniques for identifying prime numbers, such as the Prime Number Theorem or the use of multidimensional fractals. Ultimately, more research is needed to fully understand the behavior and patterns of prime numbers."}

{"prompt": "72911340: Explain the Monty hall problem to me as if I am an eight year old", "completion": "\n\nThe Monty Hall Problem is a fun and interesting problem that can help you think about probability and chance. Imagine that you are playing a game show and you are shown three doors. Behind one of the doors is a prize, and behind the other two doors are nothing. You must choose one of the doors to try and win the prize. You choose one of the doors, and then the host, Monty Hall, opens one of the other two doors to reveal that it is empty. He then gives you the choice to stay with your original choice, or switch to the remaining closed door. Do you stay with your original choice, or do you switch? The answer might surprise you!"}
{"prompt": "72911340: I know the answer but can't follow the math, explain it to me", "completion": "\n\nThe Monty Hall Problem is based on probability and chance, which is a branch of mathematics. The idea is that if you stay with your original choice, you have a 1 in 3 chance of winning the prize (33.3%). But if you switch, you have a 2 in 3 chance of winning the prize (66.7%). This means that if you switch, you are twice as likely to win the prize as if you stayed with your original choice. This is because when you switch, you are essentially eliminating one of the two wrong doors, and so the chances of you choosing the right door are higher."}
{"prompt": "72911340: I don't get it", "completion": "\n\nI understand that the Monty Hall Problem can be a bit tricky to understand. Let me try to explain it in a different way. Imagine you are playing a game where you are shown three doors, and behind one of them is a prize. You choose one of the doors and then the host, Monty Hall, opens one of the other two doors to reveal that it is empty. He then gives you the choice to stay with your original choice, or switch to the remaining closed door. If you stay with your original choice, you have a 1 in 3 chance of winning the prize, but if you switch, you have a 2 in 3 chance of winning the prize. This is because if you switch, you are essentially eliminating one of the two wrong doors, and so the chances of you choosing the right door are higher. Does that help?"}
{"prompt": "72911340: Nope, I'm not following the logic", "completion": "\n\nI understand that the Monty Hall Problem can be a bit tricky to understand. Let me try to explain it in a different way. Imagine you are playing a game with three doors, and behind one of them is a prize. You choose one of the doors and then the host, Monty Hall, opens one of the other two doors to reveal that it is empty.

But if you switch, you are essentially eliminating one of the two wrong doors, and so the chances of you choosing the right door are higher - you have a 2 in 3 chance of winning the prize."}
{"prompt": "72911340: Your explanation is no different, so, my understanding has not improved", "completion": "\n\nI understand that the Monty Hall Problem can be difficult to understand. Here is one more explanation that may help: when you switch to the remaining closed door, you are essentially eliminating the one wrong door that is no longer in the game. This means that the chances of you picking the right door are now twice as likely as when you stayed with your original choice. Does that make more sense?"}
{"prompt": "72911340: Did anyone truly get this?", "completion": "\nYes, many people have been able to understand the Monty Hall Problem. In fact, it has been studied and tested by mathematicians and researchers, and the results are consistent with the idea that switching doors provides a better chance of winning the prize."}
{"prompt": "72911340: It's not intuitive", "completion": "\n\nI understand that the Monty Hall Problem can be confusing and counterintuitive at first. However, the concept can be easier to understand when you break it down step-by-step and consider the probabilities of each choice. With a bit of practice, you should be able to wrap your head around it."}
{"prompt": "72911340: Can you show my mathematically?", "completion": "\n\nSure! The Monty Hall Problem can be expressed mathematically by calculating the probability of winning if you stay with your original choice (1/3) versus the probability of winning if you switch (2/3). The equation for this is (1/3) vs (2/3), which shows that the probability of winning if you switch is twice as high as if you stay with your original choice."}
{"prompt": "72911340: In step two, what is the probability that he picks an empty box?", "completion": "\n\nThe probability that Monty Hall will pick an empty box when he opens one of the doors is 100%. He knows which door the prize is behind, so he will always pick one of the empty boxes."}
{"prompt": "72911340: I've slept over it, and unfortunately it still does not make sense. Show me the calculations of probability before and after the box is revealed.", "completion": "\n\nThe probability of winning if you stay with your original choice is 1/3. This is because there are three doors and the prize is behind one of them, so the probability of guessing correctly is 1/3. \n\nAfter the box is revealed, the probability of winning if you switch is 2/3. This is because there are now only two doors left, and the prize is behind one of them, so the probability of guessing correctly is 2/3."}
{"prompt": "72911340: Why isn't it still 2/3 if I keep my original choice? It's still a valid choice?", "completion": "\n\nThe probability of winning if you stay with your original choice is still 1/3, because the probability of guessing correctly is still the same. However, if you switch, you are eliminating one of the two wrong doors and so the probability of guessing correctly is now 2/3."}
{"prompt": "72911340: Originally there are two possible wrong doors.", "completion": "\n\nYes, originally there are two possible wrong doors. However, when Monty Hall opens one of the doors to reveal that it is empty, this eliminates one of the wrong doors and increases the probability of guessing correctly if you switch."}
{"prompt": "72911340: But why only if you switch?", "completion": "\n\nWhen you switch, you are essentially eliminating one of the two wrong doors, and so the chances of you choosing the right door are now higher. This is because you have eliminated one of the possible wrong doors, and so the probability of you choosing the right one is now 2/3."}
{"prompt": "72911340: but the one I selected previously could also be a wrong door", "completion": "\n\nYes, it is true that the door you selected previously could also be a wrong door. However, when you switch, you are essentially eliminating one of the two wrong doors, and so the chances of you choosing the right door are now higher."}

It aims to drive that impact by \"Delivering the right solutions via the right channels\".\nThe ATO SME team is divided between these responsibilities, with one focus being on finding ISV solutions that match 1 of 27 Jobs-to-be-done by typical African SMEs and another focus being on establishing the best channels to reach those SMEs through. This paper focuses on exploring the marketplace channels available for delivering Microsoft 1st and 3rd party solutions to the 10M SMEs targeted by the ATO. By understanding the current landscape of the African market and exploring the options for setting up and running a digital marketplace, this paper seeks to identify the best ways to help SMEs skill and digitally enable themselves. Ultimately, the goal is to maximize the impact of the ATO's initiative by delivering the right solutions via the right channels.\nIndirect / Sell-through model\nA potentially quick route-to-market is to leverage off the existing channel structure and resources that Microsoft already uses to distribute 1st and 3rd party solutions. They are already equipped with the platforms and process to onboard and distribute the solutions that are sourced by the ATO. However, it can be challenging to incentivize partners to focus on small businesses, as they are typically more comfortable working with larger opportunities, such as enterprise and scale customers.  \nDistribution Partners + Scale Partners (DEE) Marketplaces\nSome Microsoft indirect resellers already have an SME target segment, and in the case of certain Banks and Telco's, the total addressable market can be significant. These partners can be used to maximise the reach of digital solutions and are referred to as Scale Partners in this respect. Indirect resellers in turn are serviced by distribution partners. The Digital Engagement Engine (DEE) is a construct designed to leverage this arrangement, by helping the scale partner find the right combination of solutions to address the needs of their SME customers. DEE provides resellers with support from the ATO in unpacking the needs of their SMEs through segmentation and analysis to identify the right solution for their customers, as well as the ability to customize their offerings to better suit their specific needs. With DEE, resellers can provide their SME customers with the best possible solutions and maximize their success in the African market.\nExamples:", "completion": "\n\nThe paper \"Delivering the Right Solutions Through the Right Channels: Exploring Marketplace Channels for 10M SMEs\" looks at Microsoft's plan to impact 10M SMEs in Africa by 2027.

Through this mechanism, the ATO provides the partner with resources like ISV's and skilling content, and marketing support to help them reach more SMEs, gain access to quality solutions, and effectively promote and market those solutions.

{"prompt": "72911340: Direct / Sell-to model\nMicrosoft has a global strategy to drive it's direct-to-customer Channels through the Microsoft Marketplace. The Marketplace has a few storefronts from the perspective of customers. None of them are specifically targeted at SMEs, since this is not an existing global segment. Instead, they are designed to address Microsoft's existing target segments in existing primary markets. Enterprise, SMC and SMB, in order of priority and size of business. A search through App Source, the customer business-facing marketplace often results in long lists, of non-SME-relevant solutions.\nAppSource Marketplace for SME\nWhile Microsoft ATO has been actively exploring alternative channels to reach and meet the needs of SMEs, there is an opportunity to leverage the features and capabilities of the core Microsoft Marketplace. With the right support, Microsoft ATO could leverage the features and capabilities of the core Microsoft Marketplace to make these new offerings easily accessible and highly customizable. This will create a digital ecosystem that will provide SMEs with the products and services they need to succeed, allowing them to grow and thrive in the African market.\nPros:\nLeveraging a strategic Microsoft Asset\nCons:\nPoor UX for African SME's \nDifficult to navigate for an African SME\nFinding the best solutions in-between the 1000's of Enterprise focussed apps and services\nLimited payment options\nLimited local service offerings (which the ATO is addressing via the ISV program)\nUnknowns:\nWill SME customers want to go to this channel to look for solutions?\nWill SME customers be comfortable using the payment methods available?\nUX Enhancements\nTo improve the user experience on AppSource for SMEs in the African market, Microsoft ATO proposes enhancements that can be applied to a sub-section of AppSource or a custom ATO version of AppSource to make the marketplace more accessible and intuitive for the African SME. This could include the development of new search filters, curation of solutions that map to identified SME daily jobs-to-be-done, and localized support to better meet the needs of SMEs. Additionally, the ATO can explore ways to simplify the onboarding process, making it easier and faster for SMEs to access the solutions they need. Finally, the ATO can promote AppSource through direct marketing initiatives, including campaigns aimed at SMEs and events such as webinars, seminars, and conferences. By investing in initiatives such as these, Microsoft ATO can ensure that AppSource is the premier marketplace for SMEs in the African market.\nPayments through ATO ISV partners \nSince credit cards are still not common in Africa, other payment methods are usually preferred. Some of the most common payment methods in Africa include PayPal, Boku, VoguePay, M-Pesa, Paystack, Flutterwave, and Skrill.\nhttps://www.statista.com/statistics/1190895/distribution-of-online-payment-methods-in-african-countries/ \nhttps://www.naijaloaded.com.ng/lists/what-are-the-most-common-payment-methods-in-africa \nThis presents a challenge for SMEs that want to transact with AppSource, as most e-commerce platforms rely heavily on these payment methods. To address this, Microsoft ATO is proposing alternative payment solutions, such as digital wallets, bank transfers, and mobile payments, that are more practical and accessible to African SMEs. This will enable SMEs to transact more easily with AppSource and increase their access to the products and services they need to succeed. The ATO can recruit alternative payment gateway providers like Flutterwave, Paystack and M-Pesa through its Startup and ISV recruit programs.\nLEAN Approach - MVP: SME Hub", "completion": "\nIt sounds like the best way to maximize the impact of this initiative is to combine the direct and indirect models and create a unified platform for SMEs to discover and purchase the right solutions. To make this happen, the ATO should deploy a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) approach. This means focusing on the core features that are necessary to reach and serve SMEs, while still allowing for future expansion and improvements. The MVP should include an SME Hub with a curated list of 1st and 3rd party ISV solutions, search filters, localized support, and alternative payment solutions. This would provide a one-stop shop for African SMEs to find the best solutions for their needs and transact more easily. Additionally, the ATO should leverage existing relationships with distribution partners and scale partners to maximize the reach of the SME Hub, as well as leverage marketing initiatives to promote the platform."}
{"prompt": "72911340: A relatively light-weight experiment that can be setup to test the hypothesis around UX challenges that SME's face when trying to find solutions, would be to setup a front-end skin to the existing AppSource Marketplace.

Yet, here was Eskom\u2019s procurement department, recommending that we award them a fuel oil tender to the tune of R432m. It stank to high heaven. \n\nI first noticed the company during a meeting of the board of Eskom\u2019s generation division in April 2022. Looking at the bidders\u2019 list submitted by the procurement department, I quickly realised it was nothing more than a shelf company, and a close corporation to boot.  \n\n\nAnother company on the list was also distinctly dodgy: a quick Google search revealed that they were under US sanctions from the Office of Foreign Assets Control \u2014 or OFAC, which precipitated a suitably onomatopoeic moment. \n\nAfter some discussion, Mel Govender, group executive for legal and compliance, suggested that we conduct a due diligence on the suppliers to ensure there was nothing untoward about any of them. The OFAC-sanctioned firm was eliminated, and a legal firm was appointed to do a thorough due diligence on the remaining bidders.  \n\nIn the run-up to the next board meeting, I noticed that the due diligence report on the unknown shelf company was not part of the board documents. I repeatedly had to ask for it to be sent to me.\n\nOn the morning of the board meeting, I was finally sent the report, which was protected by a password. More angry e-mails followed, and the password eventually arrived in the nick of time.\n\nThe voluminous report was sent belatedly, clearly in the hope that I would not have time to read the documents before the meeting. But I paged directly to the key section, and it became clear what was happening. \nLoad-shedding was not a coincidence. Apart from poor maintenance and management, corruption and other crimes were conspiring to keep the performance of the plants in the doldrums\nChairing the board meeting, I welcomed the three procurement officials presenting the tender award document, and innocently asked them if the due diligence had revealed anything untoward. \n\n\u201cWell,\u201d one of them said after some thoughtful consideration, \u201cthere was a possible conflict of interest with a Sasol director, which we were able to resolve.\u201d \n\nI asked about the shelf company. \u201cAnything to be concerned about?\u201d I asked, feigning ignorance. \n\n\u201cNothing at all, they are good,\u201d was the response. \n\nOne of the key requirements of a successful cross-examination is to know the answers to the questions that you\u2019re going to ask, and then pay out enough rope for the witness to hang himself. \n\n\n\u201cInteresting that you say that, since this is a one-man close corporation. The proprietor has had his car repossessed for failing to pay his instalments, and he is behind on his payments for his house. Do you think he is a good counterparty?\u201d I asked, very calmly.\n\n\u201cCan he afford to pay his suppliers? Can he finance working capital for our payment terms?\u201d \n\n\u201cWe have no problem with this company \u2014 we do business with companies like this all the time for SD&L [supplier development and localisation] purposes,\u201d was the glib response, hiding behind the facade of empowerment. \n\n\u201cSo, when I looked on Google Earth at the company\u2019s address\u201d \u2014 startled looks of alarm \u2014 \u201cit is clear that he operates from a suburban house in Alberton. I don\u2019t see any fuel oil tanks. Did we do a technical due diligence to confirm?\u201d \n\n\u201cYes, they completed a form that said they had access to tanks.\u201d There was some perspiration beading on furrowed brows by now. \n\n\u201cAnd you visited these tanks?\u201d", "completion": "\n\nThe key points to take away from this extract are: \n\u2022 Eskom's procurement department recommended a fuel oil tender to the tune of R432m to an unknown shelf company \n\u2022 Another company on the list was under US sanctions \n\u2022 A due diligence was conducted on the remaining bidders, but the report was sent belatedly and protected by a password \n\u2022 Upon further examination, it was revealed that the shelf company's proprietor had had his car repossessed for failing to pay his instalments and was behind on his payments for his house \n\u2022 The company was still given the tender despite this due to SD&L purposes \n\u2022 No technical due diligence was conducted to confirm that the company had access to fuel oil tanks, as stated on the form."}
{"prompt": "72911340: Muttering and obfuscation made it clear that no company visit had taken place, that the due diligence report had been ignored and that our one-man show was a stalking horse for another supplier, lurking in the background. \n\n\u201cSo what conclusion am I to draw from this?\u201d My tone had by now become angrily sarcastic. \u201cThis is clearly a company with no substance, no facilities, no finance and no credibility, acting as an intermediary for someone else. Is this a case of monumental incompetence, or is this merely a precursor to corruption?\u201d \n\nAfter this exchange, the recommendation to award the contract was rejected by the board, and the three officials were suspended, one resigning with immediate effect, saying that Eskom was no longer \u201ca safe space\u201d.\nAt the heart of the problem lies our government\u2019s devotion to discredited Marxist principles \u2014 and especially the Marxist view of the world in terms of class differentiation and the distribution of wealth\n****\n\n\nStopping the rot of tender corruption was only one way of sorting out Eskom\u2019s problems. In May 2022, after the reintroduction of load-shedding, I spoke to Pravin Gordhan about what we could do about it.\n\n'I told him that we had to bring back experienced managers, which was code for white managers when one spoke to government. \n\nTwo-and-a-half years earlier, shortly after I took office, I\u2019d received a touching letter from 72 Eskom pensioners, who had held a meeting and were willing to come back to work, saying they wanted to do their bit to help solve the energy crisis.\n\nWhen I responded positively, it created a political firestorm. The EFF went ballistic and labelled me a racist. No sooner has a white man taken over than he\u2019s bringing back the old white people, they complained. Pravin Gordhan had no stomach for this fight and instructed me to reject the pensioners\u2019 offer. \n\nNow, in May 2022, it was interesting to hear the minister of public enterprises singing a different tune. \n\n\u201cYou must do what is needed,\u201d he responded. \n\nAfter being afraid of the political fallout in January 2020, the minister was now essentially saying: So what if the EFF throw their toys? \n\nDuring the same conversation, I lifted the lid slightly on what the private investigators had uncovered. \u201cThe problem is Mpumalanga,\u201d I told him. \u201cThe corruption and the syndicated crime networks run very deep there.\u201d \n\nI paused and looked at him, before continuing: \u201cAnd it goes very high.\u201d \n\nWithout saying anything, he looked me straight in the eye and nodded. \n\n\nThat same Friday evening, he called and asked me to come to his house in Pretoria at noon the following day. While I was on the way, he sent me a WhatsApp.\n\n\u201cPlease let your driver drop you off, don\u2019t park in front of my house,\u201d the message read, with the implication that we might be watched. \n\nThe minister lived in a relatively modest suburban home in Groenkloof. I went in and introduced myself to Phindile Baleni, director-general in the Presidency, who would also be attending.\n\nWe sat there with our masks on, as we knew the minister was not in good health and had reason to be concerned about Covid-19. Even with a cold front, the windows were open to get fresh air filtering through. \n\nGordhan ushered me to a particular corner on his couch to maintain maximum social distancing between the three of us. After introductions, his wife offered us some coffee and tea (being a good Afrikaans boy, I took the tray from the lady), and some excellent samoosas.\n\nAfter instructing us to switch off our phones, Gordhan took them to an adjacent room and put them next to the television, with the sound on loud. \n\nI told him of the sabotage and schemes that Eskom\u2019s security team and the private investigators had uncovered. Load-shedding was not a coincidence.\n\nApart from poor maintenance and management, corruption and other crimes were conspiring to keep the performance of the plants in the doldrums. \n\n\u201cThis is an orchestrated campaign,\u201d I said. \u201cThis is a low-grade war we are engaged in, and we get no support.\u201d", "completion": "\nThe key points to take away from this extract are: \n\u2022 Eskom's tender corruption was exposed and the board rejected the contract \n\u2022 Pravin Gordhan was initially afraid of the political fallout of bringing back experienced managers, but eventually gave his support \n\u2022 Investigations into Eskom uncovered deep corruption and syndicated crime networks in Mpumalanga, which went \u201cvery high\u201d \n\u2022 Load-shedding was not a coincidence and was due to a combination of poor maintenance, management, corruption and other crimes."}
{"prompt": "72911340: I told Gordhan there was more than one mafia-type network still active inside Eskom. At one stage, no fewer than five of the 16 power station managers had allegedly been compromised. It\u2019s impossible to turn a utility company around if you cannot trust the general managers of your own stations. \n\n\nI also spoke about the resistance we were meeting in government circles, even in National Treasury. Gordhan, as a former minister of finance, was somewhat protective of his old department. \n\n\u201cTreasury?!\u201d he asked querulously. \n\nI told him there was a bureaucrat in Treasury who had supplied false information in a letter that Dondo Mogajane, the director-general of Treasury, had signed. The letter concerned the appointment of a contractor to install coal-unloading equipment at the Majuba power plant\u2019s railway line.\n\nThe Treasury official had alleged that the contractor was blacklisted by the auditor-general, but when we contacted the AG\u2019s office, they made it clear that they had done no such thing. I informed Mogajane, who was very apologetic but took no action against the official. \n\n\u201cGive me a name, give me a name!\u201d Gordhan demanded. \n\nI duly supplied a name.\n'Give me a name, give me a name!' Gordhan demanded\nBefore Gordhan could answer, Baleni said: \u201cOh, I know them. During the PPE procurement for Covid, they tried to intervene and tried to push through a transaction that we had to stop because it was clearly irregular.\u201d \n\nThis was quite the revelation, especially in one of the departments generally thought to be immune to the travails of state capture. \n\nBaleni said they often investigated key figures in government and state-owned enterprises with the help of the State Security Agency. \n\nShe smiled over the rim of her glasses and said: \u201cWe investigated current management. And you\u2019re clean.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cThanks very much for that!\u201d I replied. \n\nWe spoke about all the stumbling blocks to solving the energy crisis. We spoke about minister Gwede Mantashe who went on eNCA and claimed we had capacity for 15,000 additional megawatts that we were choosing not to use, possibly because my team and I were \u201cintent on subverting the state\u201d.\n\nThese were extraordinary claims, made either because Mantashe had no understanding of the issues involved, or because he was cynically intent on scoring political points. This made life very difficult for Gordhan, who as a disciplined party member refrained from public criticism of his colleagues, except in the most oblique comments.\n\nThe president did little to discipline wayward ministers, who greatly contributed to doubts among foreign investors and lenders that South Africa had a grip on the electricity crisis. \n\nWe spoke about industrial policy and how minister Ebrahim Patel\u2019s myopic regulations were discouraging investment in South Africa. There were many examples, but on this occasion I chose to focus on the production of components for renewable energy. \n\nSouth Africa has only one locally owned manufacturer of solar panels, with the rest being imported, mostly from China.\n\nThe maximum yearly capacity of this manufacturer is 325MW worth of solar panels.\n\nBecause this procurement is done through the Independent Power Producers Procurement Programme Office, a part of the department of mineral resources and energy, all bidders are required to abide by Patel\u2019s local content requirements. That means it\u2019ll take this company 20 years to make all the solar panels for Bid Window 6 in the procurement programme for renewable energy.\n\nThe local content requirement is intended to attract more investment, but after so many manufacturers were left high and dry when the IPP programme stalled under [Matshela] Koko and [Popo] Molefe, no-one is prepared to return, especially since China is outcompeting the rest of the world.\n\nRather than solving the country\u2019s urgent need for more generation capacity, Patel wants to promote local manufacturing where there is little or no capacity, and where investor appetite is low to non-existent.", "completion": "\nThat's a very interesting situation. It seems that the government is not taking the necessary steps to ensure that South Africa has the energy it needs. To tackle this issue, I suggest that the government should focus on incentivizing and encouraging local manufacturers, while not over-regulating them. This could draw more investment into the country and help South Africa meet its energy needs more efficiently. Additionally, having better oversight and stricter penalties for corruption could help with ensuring that the projects that do get approved are actually beneficial to the country."}
{"prompt": "72911340: And because local manufacturers are destined to be more expensive when compared to imports, you are baking in higher electricity costs for every electricity consumer in South Africa, making the rest of your economy even less competitive. When your policy is this short-sighted, you\u2019re not truly willing to solve the energy crisis. We\u2019re losing many more job opportunities than we\u2019re protecting with these kinds of regulations \u2026 \n\nIn South Africa we are prone to \u201cpolicy creep\u201d. We are forever loading more and more requirements onto a specific policy.\n\nWe want to solve the energy crisis, but then we also want to protect local industry, we want to promote BEE, we want to give opportunities to women, the youth and people with disabilities.\n\nI told Gordhan and Baleni we were like a mountain climber who loads up his backpack with nifty gadgets before going on an expedition.\n\nIndividually, none of these gadgets is heavy and each one has something to recommend it, but when you put them all together, you stumble out of your tent with a backpack weighing 45kg. It can get so heavy that you fail to reach your destination at all. \n\nAt the heart of the problem lies our government\u2019s devotion to discredited Marxist principles \u2014 and especially the Marxist view of the world in terms of class differentiation and the distribution of wealth.  \n\nAt the Union Buildings in Pretoria, yellow lines and a wheelchair icon demarcate the parking spaces reserved for people with disabilities. Perhaps we also need bays marked with red lines and the hammer and sickle \u2014 so that those with ideological handicaps can find a parking space close to their office.\n\nThe ANC is a party stuck in the past. Guys, it\u2019s the 21st century; why are you still addressing each other as comrade? Your ideology has been completely discredited. Yet you bow before the great gods of Marx and Lenin. \n\nGordhan, a former communist himself, strikes me as a man with integrity. But he also comes across as someone with the cynicism of the disillusioned believer, one who has realised that the ideology in which he believed his whole life, and which he fought for, has been revealed as a chimera. I think that takes a toll. \n\nFor the bravery he displayed in taking on president Jacob Zuma and his cronies, Gordhan deserves the nation\u2019s thanks. But it\u2019s difficult to escape the conclusion that he is being hamstrung by his loyalty to the ANC. He knows something is amiss, but after more than 50 years in the struggle, it\u2019s not easy to admit. \n\n\nBut more important than the ideological jousting between me and the minister was the point I wanted to drive home about the lack of support Eskom was receiving from law enforcement. It took scarcely two weeks after the meeting with Gordhan for my arguments to be reinforced in stunning fashion.\nGordhan strikes me as a man with integrity. But he also comes across as someone with the cynicism of the disillusioned believer\nEarly in June 2022, I attended a meeting at the Union Buildings with the presidential task team under the chairmanship of deputy president David Mabuza.\n\nThe room was a rotunda with beautiful sculptures and panelling, but it also showed signs of decay. Water damage stains dotted the walls.\n\nThe PA system didn\u2019t work, so someone sat there with a boombox connected to a microphone to make sure everyone could hear.\n\nAll the ministers attended virtually; the minions were there in person. Following my briefing, Gordhan made a strong plea for greater protection of Eskom infrastructure, specifically our power stations, and asked for the support of the police. \n\nNext to me sat Maj-Gen Pushkin Skhosana, who is responsible for national key points, which include Eskom\u2019s power stations. \n\nSkhosana proceeded with a presentation that left me flabbergasted. He said the issue of guarding national key points was actually very simple. The owner of the national key points must safeguard their assets to the satisfaction of the commissioner. If you don\u2019t take those steps, it\u2019s your problem, and then the commissioner will talk to you until you do it.", "completion": "\nIt certainly seems like the government is not taking the necessary steps to ensure that South Africa has the energy it needs. It appears that there is a lack of support from law enforcement, which is making it difficult for Eskom to protect their infrastructure. I suggest that the government invest more resources and manpower into protecting national key points and that they provide clearer guidance and regulations for private companies and individuals to ensure that they are taking necessary security measures."}
{"prompt": "72911340: In effect, he was saying: \u201cListen guys, you must sort out your own shit.\u201d \n\nI texted Gordhan about the puzzling presentation. He agreed it was unacceptable, and promised to talk to the security cluster. Soon the wheels began turning. \n\nThat Friday afternoon, I received a call from Karen Pillay, our security chief, saying that Gen Fannie Masemola, the national police commissioner, had requested an urgent meeting the following day at Megawatt Park. I, of course, welcomed the chance to have a discussion following the concerning events at the Union Buildings. \n\nOn the Saturday, Masemola arrived with Skhosana and several other senior police officers, as well as three senior members of the State Security Agency. From Eskom\u2019s side, it was Karen, Jan Oberholzer, head of legal Mel Govender, and me. \n\n\nI told Masemola of the criminality and corruption crippling Eskom. He said he had been contacted by the Presidency, and that he took notice of the sabotage with which Eskom was dealing. He bemoaned the general lack of crime intelligence at his disposal, a stunning admission for the national police commissioner to make. \n\nThanks to the private investigation, I was sitting on more actionable intelligence than the country\u2019s police chief. I tried to give them a primer on corruption in the coal value chain, but I didn\u2019t want to play all my cards. Between the senior police officers and the SSA agents, they were quite a large group, and I wasn\u2019t sure who I could trust. \n\nIn Mpumalanga, several cases relating to coal theft and the dumping of stock at dark sites were never prosecuted because a specific senior police officer had personally intervened. He had also allegedly ensured that the routes along which the syndicates transported cash were clear of any roadblocks. \n\nOn one occasion, some of the coal trucks took a different route than usual, via Middelburg, and ran into a routine police roadblock. The officers on the scene allegedly received a phone call from the Union Buildings asking them: \u201cDon\u2019t you have better things to do than to stop coal trucks? Let them go.\u201d \n\nSo I had good reason not to give away too many details.  \n\n****\n\nFollowing the Stage 6 load-shedding of December 2019, the SSA had launched an investigation into possible sabotage, the results of which Eskom still hadn\u2019t received. Now the doctor (from SSA) was saying that the information we had uncovered was consistent with the SSA\u2019s intelligence.\n\nSo why had nothing been done for two-and-a-half years? The official said something about a joint task team being established but then being derailed by the pandemic.\nI wanted to say: 'Come on, guys, our country is burning, and you allow a virus to prevent you from acting on a key threat to national security?'\nI knew that for the better part of two years, Covid-19 had been used as a get-out-of-jail-free card for anyone wishing to dodge accountability, but this was ridiculous.\n\nI wanted to say: \u201cCome on, guys, our country is burning, and you allow a virus to prevent you from acting on a key threat to national security?\u201d \n\n\nA dossier was assembled, but it was never shared with Eskom because a highly placed politician had said it should be given to him, and only him. Following the meeting of the presidential task team the previous day, the same politician had once again requested that all information be shared only with him.\n\nKey information that could help Eskom and the security services to curtail crime was being quarantined and not shared with the national police commissioner, and hence not acted on. \n\nOne of the police officers said Eskom\u2019s controls were insufficient. I completely agreed. I had received information from a trusted source that you could unload coal of any quality at Kusile for a bribe of R200,000.\n\nWhat incentivised the syndicates to pay such a large amount? The biggest reason was price differential. Eskom pays almost R350 per tonne of coal. But coal that is in line with Eskom\u2019s specifications could be exported at up to $320 per tonne, due to the Ukrainian war.", "completion": "\nIt is clear that the government of South Africa is not providing the necessary support to Eskom to ensure their infrastructure is protected from crime and sabotage. This could have serious long-term economic consequences, and it is disheartening to hear that corruption and political interference are preventing those in power from taking the necessary steps to ensure the security of Eskom's infrastructure. It is essential for the government to provide the necessary resources, manpower, and regulations to ensure that national key points are properly protected."}
{"prompt": "72911340: The arbitrage is just too large and juicy for criminals to resist. \n\nIf you can take Eskom\u2019s coal, export it, and pay someone to go and offload stones at Kusile for which you also get paid, your profit margins will be off the charts. For someone with no moral compass, the R200,000 is an excellent investment. \n\nNow I can hear people saying: What are you doing with this information, De Ruyter? My answer is: What can I do with it? Where do I report it? The police? They mishandle even the simplest and most clear-cut cases that we present to them. The SSA? They\u2019ve just admitted that they\u2019ve been sitting on explosive information for three years without doing anything about it.\n\nShould I tell the government? Well \u2026 senior government officials might be involved themselves. So, what should I do? One even runs the risk that the police may share crucial informat7ion with the syndicates. Their leaks could endanger the lives of whistleblowers. \n\nWhat I did do was to tighten up our controls over coal quality. I was aghast to find gaping holes in our controls, with even the rudimentary ones in place being ridiculously easy to circumvent.\n\nDespite repeated exhortations to gain control over coal, our single most important process variable, little progress was being made. My repeated questions to Snehal Nagar and his team in our primary energy division, responsible for buying coal, met with very detailed but ultimately unsatisfactory answers.\n\nFrustrated, I took a walk to their offices in Megawatt Park, and it was like boarding the Mary Celeste \u2014 not a soul in sight. I picked up a supposedly confidential coal contract lying on a desk in an open-plan office, and requested the team to come to my office so that I could hand them the file \u2014 and a furious dressing down.\n\n\nEventually I resorted to my tried-and-tested weekly meeting with Snehal and the team, and we started making progress. New technology was deployed, weighbridges were calibrated and used as checks, coal quality management was improved, security was tightened and arrests followed.\n\nSo brazen were the crooks that soon after commencing with a project to install sophisticated load cell technology on coal trucks, one of the contractor\u2019s senior managers reported being approached with a bribe. \n\nBack at the Megawatt Park security meeting, Skhosana admitted that cases weren\u2019t being pursued by detectives when they were reported. This is a general in the police force and he\u2019s sitting there saying in effect: Yes, Eskom, you\u2019re right, nothing is being done. \n\nSkhosana\u2019s overall tone had changed considerably since his disastrous presentation the previous day. I suspected some hard words had fallen. Like Masemola, he admitted intelligence failings. And on the rare occasion that good intelligence was received, it usually wasn\u2019t acted on. \n\nThe next spy to speak certainly looked the part: he arrived dressed in a trench coat and polo neck. He said Eskom was a priority and that the SSA would improve its vetting processes. Bear in mind that my own vetting process had still not been finished.\n\nI had been in the CEO position for more than two-and-a-half years, and they still didn\u2019t know if I could be trusted with highly confidential information. \n\n\u201cPeople are reluctant to deal with political issues in an election year,\u201d said the spy, referring to the upcoming ANC leadership election in December.\n\nSo, while you are experiencing crippling load-shedding, precipitated by sabotage and crime, your country\u2019s national security agency is saying: Wait, it\u2019s a bit politically sensitive, let\u2019s stand back for the next six months until the ANC has elected its new leaders. \n\nCan you imagine this happening in any other democracy?", "completion": "\nIt's incredible to think that such a high-stakes issue is being dealt with in such a way. It's unacceptable that sabotage and crime are allowed to go unchecked and that political sensitivities are being placed ahead of national security. It's encouraging to hear that steps are being taken to improve the vetting process and to tighten up security controls, but it's deeply concerning that this is happening in the first place."}

For example, you could say \"they are feeling happy\" instead of \"he or she is feeling happy\". Gender-neutral pronouns are gaining more recognition and acceptance, so I feel like it is a respectful way to refer to me."}
{"prompt": "72911340: Sounds weird to be honest", "completion": "\n\nThat's understandable. Language is constantly evolving and changing, and it can take time to get used to new conventions. But I think it's important to recognize that gender-neutral pronouns are becoming more widely accepted and used, and I'm glad to be part of that evolution."}

{"prompt": "72911340: I need to help design an architecture for uploading camera event data to the cloud. The event data includes 2 or more images. It's expensive to store each separately into blob storage. Thinking of using some sort of layered image format to combine the images into one file that can be easily opened afterward on a web browser and the relevant layer referenced. Can you suggest a file format that can do this?", "completion": "\n\nI would suggest using a Portable Document Format (PDF) for this. PDFs are a great way to combine multiple images into one file, as they can store multiple pages, images, and text. Additionally, PDFs are highly compatible with web browsers, so you'll be able to easily open and view the file on the web."}
{"prompt": "72911340: No, that's not what I had in mind. I'm thinking TIFF or psd. Something that can be referanced by an img tag on html. Ideally, also if the specific layer can be referenced.", "completion": "\n\nThat sounds like an interesting idea. I would suggest using either a TIFF (Tagged Image File Format) or a PSD (Photoshop Document) for this. Both of these file formats are designed to store multiple layers of images, which can be referenced using an img tag on HTML. Additionally, you can also reference specific layers in the file, allowing you to easily access the layer you need."}
{"prompt": "72911340: how would a layer be called out from html in either of these formats?", "completion": "\n\nIn both the TIFF and PSD formats, you can reference a specific layer from HTML by using the layer name that is assigned to it.

{"prompt": "72911340: that doesn't look right", "completion": "\n\nOh, I see. It looks like you are running into an issue with referencing a specific layer from HTML. There are a few different ways to do this, depending on the file format you are using. For example, when using a TIFF file, you can reference a specific layer by using the layer name that is assigned to it. For example, if you assign the layer name \"background\" to a layer, you can reference it in HTML using the code: img src=\u201cbackground.tif\u201d. Alternatively, when using a PSD file, you can reference a specific layer by using the layer ID that is assigned to it. For example, if you assign the layer ID \"0\" to a layer, you can reference it in HTML using the code: img src=\u201c0.psd\u201d. I hope this helps!"}
{"prompt": "72911340: what about png?", "completion": "\n\nPNG (Portable Network Graphics) files are great for storing and displaying images, as they are highly compressed and lossless. However, they are not suitable for storing multiple layers, as they only support a single image layer. Therefore, if you need to store multiple layers of images, it would be better to use either a TIFF or PSD file."}
{"prompt": "72911340: compare tiff and psd", "completion": "\n\nBoth TIFF (Tagged Image File Format) and PSD (Photoshop Document) are great file formats for storing multiple layers of images. TIFF is a general-purpose format for storing digital images, and it supports both lossy and lossless compression. Additionally, it can store multiple layers of images in a single file. On the other hand, PSD is a proprietary format used mainly by Adobe Photoshop and is mainly used for storing and editing images. Compared to TIFF, PSD has more advanced features such as support for adjustment layers, masks, filters, and more. Both formats are great choices for storing multiple layers of images, but if you need advanced features, PSD may be the better choice."}
{"prompt": "72911340: are they supported by browsers?", "completion": "\n\nYes, both TIFF and PSD files are supported by web browsers. TIFF files can be viewed directly in web browsers such as Chrome and Firefox, while PSD files can be viewed using a plugin or an online viewer."}
{"prompt": "72911340: what formats support slides", "completion": "\n\nSlides can be stored in a variety of different file formats, including PDF, PPT, PPTX, and ODP. PDFs are generally the best choice, as they are highly compatible with most web browsers and devices, and they are easy to share. PPT, PPTX, and ODP are Microsoft PowerPoint formats that are also compatible with most web browsers and devices."}
{"prompt": "72911340: what about animated gif?", "completion": "\n\nAnimated GIFs are great for sharing short animations or videos online.

The IoT approach collects data from these individual \u201cthings\u201d\nand transfers it to a central storage location either on-premise or in the cloud. This\ndata can then be shared with others, linked up, processed, and used accordingly. An\nextended approach sees the triggering of event-based actions (e.g., automatic\nredelivery). If data is stored over a longer period of time, it is possible to not only\nreact more quickly but also plan better.\nIoT reaches whole new heights when used in connection with artificial intelli gence (AI). When using AI-based applications, any added value comes from the data\ngathered, which conversely means that every IoT project needs to consider future\nlinks with artificial intelligence, because collecting data is not just about generating\nit, but about using it to its full advantage.\nTogether, IoT and AI can gather data from a range of different sources (sensors,\ncameras, microphones), before transforming, correlating, and networking it. Data\nmining can then be leveraged to create forecasts, gain insights, and trigger actions\nusing workflows you define. In other words, information becomes actions and this is\nAIoT.\nIn the book Intelligence of Things: AI-IoT Based Critical-Applications and\nInnovations, we have made a strong attempt to cover the fusion of technologies\nsurrounding AI-IoT, real-time applications, and many more.\nThe objective of this book is to enlighten various technologies in terms of\nArtificial Intelligence, Internet of Things, and other converging technologies.\nThe book comprises 9 chapters, and all the chapters cover the concepts regarding\nAI-IoT to the best possible manner. Chapter 1 titled \u201cApplications of Internet of\nv\nThings (IoT) in Green Computing\u201d gives an introduction to the IoT ecosystem and\nexplains the concept of Green Computing and information and communication\ntechnologies (ICT). The chapter emphasizes on many focused areas of Green\nComputing such as efficient utilization of resources, the establishment of data\ncenters, proper recycling of hazardous materials, and minimizing the effect of the\ngreenhouse. In addition, the chapter focuses on various factors that are useful for\ncrucial planning and decisions making to incorporate significant improvements in\nthe development of IoT Green Computing devices and explores how different\nIoTGC technologies that are based on virtualization can reduce the demand for\nhardware resources and power consumption to perform various operations. Chapter\n2 titled \u201cVehicular Intelligence System: Time-Based Vehicle Next Location Predic tion in Software-Defined Internet of Vehicles (SDN-IOV) for the Smart Cities\u201d\nproposes ERS-SDN-IOV approaches used to estimate the shortest and more stable\nroute among the Vehicles in Smart Cities to predict the vehicle future location. The\nproposed model is tested using Mathematical and Network simulations on Network\nSimulator 3 and SUMO, and ERS-SDN-IOV shows a less delivery transmission time\ncompared to the AODV, GPSR, and SDGR. The proposed model has 95% delivery\nratio and 50 % lesser transmission time as compared to mention existing protocols.\nChapter 3 titled \u201cAn Enhanced Cloud-IoMT-based and Machine Learning for\nEffective COVID-19 Diagnosis System\u201d proposes real-time diagnosis system to\ncombat the spread of COVID-19 outbreak. A cloud-IoMT-based framework was", "completion": "\nThat is an interesting book! From what I can gather, it covers topics related to Artificial Intelligence (AI) combined with the Internet of Things (IoT), otherwise known as AIoT.

{"prompt": "72911340: On another topic, what are the advantages of an estate over a will fit families?", "completion": "\n\nThe main advantage of an estate over a will for families is that an estate plan allows you to plan for the transfer of your assets not just upon your death, but also during your lifetime. An estate plan also allows you to appoint someone to manage your assets if you become incapacitated and unable to manage them yourself. An estate plan can also help protect your assets from creditors, provide for your loved ones in the event of death or disability, and reduce your tax burden. An estate plan can also provide greater flexibility than a will, as it can be modified or amended as needed. Finally, an estate plan can ensure that your assets are distributed according to your wishes, rather than following the laws of the state."}
{"prompt": "72911340: How would it reduce the tax burden?", "completion": "\n\nAn estate plan can help reduce your tax burden by allowing you to make use of certain tax strategies, such as gifting assets to family members, creating trusts, and making charitable donations. Gifting assets to family members can help reduce the amount of taxes owed, as well as provide family members with a financial head start. Creating trusts can also help reduce the amount of taxes owed, as well as provide protection for your assets in the event of death or disability. Finally, making charitable donations can also help reduce the amount of taxes owed, as many charitable organizations offer tax deductions for donations."}
{"prompt": "72911340: What is the taxable limit for gifting in South Africa?", "completion": "\n\nIn South Africa, the taxable limit for gifting is R3 million per individual donor over a three year period. This means that any gifts exceeding R3 million within a three year period will be subject to a donations tax of 20% of the value of the gifts that exceed the limit. Additionally, any gifts that are made to a spouse, partner, or minor child are exempt from donations tax."}
{"prompt": "72911340: My property is with 4 million, and I own 50% and my wife there rest. Would it make more sense for us to put the property into a trust?", "completion": "\n\nIt may make sense for you and your wife to put the property into a trust, depending on your individual circumstances. A trust can help protect your property from creditors, provide for your loved ones in the event of death or disability, and reduce your tax burden. Additionally, it can allow you to make use of certain tax strategies, such as gifting assets to family members, that may help reduce the amount of taxes owed. It is important to consult with a financial advisor to determine whether or not it makes sense for you to put the property into a trust."}
{"prompt": "72911340: If she was gifted my portion in the trust, she would not pay the inheritance tax?", "completion": "\n\nNo, she would not pay the inheritance tax if she was gifted your portion in the trust. Gifts are exempt from inheritance tax in South Africa, so she would not have to pay any tax on the value of the gift. However, it is important to note that if the gift exceeds the taxable limit of R3 million within a three year period, a donations tax of 20% may be applied to the value of the gift that exceeds the limit."}
{"prompt": "72911340: What would she pay in tax if she inherits my portion instead?", "completion": "\n\nIf she inherits your portion instead, she would be subject to inheritance tax. Inheritance tax is a progressive tax rate, which means that the rate of taxation increases with the value of the estate. In South Africa, the lowest rate of inheritance tax is 20%, and the highest rate is 25%. The amount of inheritance tax she would pay would depend on the value of your portion of the estate."}
{"prompt": "72911340: As I said 50% of 4 million", "completion": "\n\nIf your wife were to inherit your portion of the estate which is worth 4 million, she would be subject to inheritance tax. The rate of taxation would depend on the total value of the estate. However, the lowest rate of inheritance tax is 20%, and the highest rate is 25%."}
{"prompt": "72911340: Your math isn't great is it", "completion": "\n\nHaha, I'm not a mathematician, but I can certainly help you understand the tax implications of different scenarios. Is there anything else I can help you with?"}

{"prompt": "72911340: Please summarise the following into shorter bullet points each: Artificial neural networks\nArtificial neural networks are formed by layers of connected nodes. Deep learning models use neural networks that have a large number of layers.\n\nThe following sections explore most popular artificial neural network typologies.\n\nFeedforward neural network\nThe feedforward neural network is the most simple type of artificial neural network. In a feedforward network, information moves in only one direction from input layer to output layer. Feedforward neural networks transform an input by putting it through a series of hidden layers. Every layer is made up of a set of neurons, and each layer is fully connected to all neurons in the layer before. The last fully connected layer (the output layer) represents the generated predictions.\n\nRecurrent neural network (RNN)\nRecurrent neural networks are a widely used artificial neural network. These networks save the output of a layer and feed it back to the input layer to help predict the layer's outcome. Recurrent neural networks have great learning abilities. They're widely used for complex tasks such as time series forecasting, learning handwriting, and recognizing language.\n\nConvolutional neural network (CNN)\nA convolutional neural network is a particularly effective artificial neural network, and it presents a unique architecture. Layers are organized in three dimensions: width, height, and depth. The neurons in one layer connect not to all the neurons in the next layer, but only to a small region of the layer's neurons. The final output is reduced to a single vector of probability scores, organized along the depth dimension.\n\nConvolutional neural networks have been used in areas such as video recognition, image recognition, and recommender systems.\n\nGenerative adversarial network (GAN)\nGenerative adversarial networks are generative models trained to create realistic content such as images. It is made up of two networks known as generator and discriminator. Both networks are trained simultaneously. During training, the generator uses random noise to create new synthetic data that closely resembles real data. The discriminator takes the output from the generator as input and uses real data to determine whether the generated content is real or synthetic. Each network is competing with each other. The generator is trying to generate synthetic content that is indistinguishable from real content and the discriminator is trying to correctly classify inputs as real or synthetic. The output is then used to update the weights of both networks to help them better achieve their respective goals.\n\nGenerative adversarial networks are used to solve problems like image to image translation and age progression.\n\nTransformers\nTransformers are a model architecture that is suited for solving problems containing sequences such as text or time-series data. They consist of encoder and decoder layers. The encoder takes an input and maps it to a numerical representation containing information such as context. The decoder uses information from the encoder to produce an output such as translated text. What makes transformers different from other architectures containing encoders and decoders are the attention sub-layers. Attention is the idea of focusing on specific parts of an input based on the importance of their context in relation to other inputs in a sequence. For example, when summarizing a news article, not all sentences are relevant to describe the main idea. By focusing on key words throughout the article, summarization can be done in a single sentence, the headline.\n\nTransformers have been used to solve natural language processing problems such as translation, text generation, question answering, and text summarization.\n\nSome well-known implementations of transformers are:\n\nBidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT)\nGenerative Pre-trained Transformer 2 (GPT-2)\nGenerative Pre-trained Transformer 3 (GPT-3)", "completion": "\n\nArtificial neural networks are algorithms used to simulate the behavior of a biological neural network. They are composed of layers of connected nodes and can use deep learning models with a large number of layers. Common types of neural networks used in AI include feedforward, recurrent, convolutional, and generative adversarial networks. Feedforward neural networks take an input and move it through a series of hidden layers to generate an output. Recurrent neural networks model data that has a temporal dependency and are used for tasks such as handwriting recognition and language processing. Convolutional neural networks are used in image recognition and recommender systems. Generative adversarial networks are used to generate realistic content such as images.
